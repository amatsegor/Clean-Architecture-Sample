# Clean-Architecture-Sample

Here's a simple Android app on which I've tried to implement a Clean Architecture as it should be "as the book says", using:

* Kotlin
* Dagger 2
* RxJava 2

So, a dependency rule is there, you can take a `data` layer and test it separately, without mocking a `Context`, only mocking data sources
